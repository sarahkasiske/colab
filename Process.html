            <p>Our process took place in four phases, exploration, ideation, experimentation and creation. In the exploration phase we learned about the brain, senses, videography and music from experts in the field as well as some secondary research. This helped us gain an initial understanding of the possibilities within our project. The second phase was ideology, in this phase we explored what the experiment could be. After deciding on a path for the experience we experimented, testing out theories and expanding and adapting our initial idea for the experience. Finally, in the creation phase we began building the experience.</p>

            <h2>Exploration</h2>
            <p>After reading the creative brief given to us by Alexandra Kuechenberg & Dr. Jorge Perez Gallego we began learning about the brain and how it can be affected by music.  As none of us are neuroscientists or professional musicians we began conducting research to better understand our project. We were very lucky to have the chance of learning directly from professionals in the field. Dr. Elizabeth Losin a University of Miami Professor of Psychology talked to us about the brain, helping us to gain an understanding of how the brain functions. Pablo Currea a FIU Ph.D. student explained what perception is and gave us some intriguing examples of synesthesia. Our last speaker, filmmaker Jonathan David Kane gave us insight into the topic of non-linear storytelling. After absorbing the information presented to us we took our new knowledge and began diving deeper into our research conducting research online, reading articles and studies about the brain and music. Once we felt we had a substantial base of knowledge regarding these topics we began to explore the possibilities of our project.</p>

            <h2>Ideation</h2>
            <p>After immersing ourselves in research, we began the process of ideation. Breaking into small groups we brainstormed different ideas. Spending some time brainstorming allowed us to think through many ideas of what the experience could be and narrow them down. Once each group found an idea they believed in we pitched the ideas to each other. Discussing our ideas as a team allowed us to combine different elements of each pitch into one concept were all passionate about. While lengthy and at times frustrating this process was essential in developing the experience. </p>

            <h2>Experimentation</h2>
            <p>As soon as we decided on an idea we began experimenting. This process went hand in hand with creation as we needed to build the EEG headset and code in order to test our theory. By testing with the EEG we hoped to discover exactly what information we could collect from the brain. Using an Open BCI EEG we were able to gather data from musicians and non-musicians. After collecting this data, we observed the information and decided what data we would use to create the visualization presented to the audience in the experience. </p>

            <h2>Creation</h2>
            <p>In this phase we created the documentation needed to prove our concept. Some of the content created included 3D models, illustrations, designs, wireframes, code and prototypes for interactive digital displays. All of the materials created in this phase were used in the presentation of our idea.</p>
