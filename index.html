        <h1>On a High Note</h1>
          <p>On a High Note is an interactive user experience that merges symphonic performances, art, and innovations in neurotechnology.</p>

              <p>At the beginning of this project we were presented with a challenge by Ms. Alexandra Kuechenberg & Dr. Jorge Perez Gallego: “The human mind is incredibly complex. But we as humans are seeing, feeling, hearing or smelling at all moments of our existence with little to no thought on how our minds are processing this information. Due to advancements in technology, findings in the field of neuroscience are being uncovered at an unprecedented rate. The same technologies researchers use to push forward scientific discoveries are now being commercialized, giving designers the means to create products and experiences that educate audiences beyond the scientific fields. The Corpus Callosum neuro-imaging software should solve the problem of neuroscience seeming inaccessible to a general audience including young adults, millennials, science professionals and academics.”</p>

              <p>Building off of this challenge we created an experience created an event to be held in the Frost Science Museums planetarium. This event would be held in conjunction with the New World Symphony. The event will consist of three interactive experiences, immersive learning, the planetarium experience.</p>

              <h2>Immersive Learning</h2>
              <p>As attendees arrive they will be immersed in an interactive Symphony Performance. Attendees will learn and explore in a hands-on learning environment while listening and viewing a concert streamed live from the New World Symphony. The Symphony performance will be an integral part of the event and will be streamed throughout the event, allowing attendees to experience and understand how music impacts the brain. While attendees arrive they will be able to interact with large interactive displays, while viewing projections of the New World Symphony before the event begins.</p>

                <h2>Planetarium Experience</h2>
                <p>After exploring information about music and the brain attendees will move into an experience within the Frost Science Museums planetarium. As they move into the planetarium they will be given heart rate monitors and led to their seats. As the audience is seated they will be able to view 360 video of the New World Symphony, streamed directly from the performance. Once the experience begins the audience will be briefly introduced to the science behind the brain to provide further context. The audience will learn about how the brain reacts to music through projections of neural activity collected by EEG technology from someone listening to the symphony. The audience’s response to the experience will measured through their heart rate and will be displayed on the dome of the planetarium in real-time as another layer of visualization.</p>

                <p>When the planetarium experience comes to an end the audience will be led out of the planetarium and into an area of interactive exploration. This area will consolidate the concepts presented throughout the experience, presenting the audience with a tangible representation of all the data collected. Interactive stations will allow the audience to play and learn as they listen to the inspiring music from the New World Symphony. In addition to the music, projections of the New World Symphony performance will be displayed. With this experience we hope to provide attendees with a knowledge and understanding of how music impacts the brain. After leaving the experience attendees will be able to learn more about the experience and explore their personal data online through a website created for the event.</p>
